  <h2 class="name">Golden-bristle Grass</h2>
  <div class="latin">Setaria sphacelata</div>

  <p>
    A tufted grass with narrow, blue-green leaves. Tall golden inflorescences are seen from October to May. Habitat: Grassland; wetland.

  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Seed Production: The large, golden seed heads (panicles) are a critical food source for granivorous birds, including the Long-tailed Widowbird, waxbills, and weavers.</li>
    <li>An essential larval host plant for several butterfly species, primarily within the Skipper (Hesperiidae) and Brown (Satyrinae) families. </li>
    <li>Bridge between terrestrial and wetland habitats. Provides essential shelter and breeding grounds for a vast array of wetland-dependent insects, which form the base of the habitat's food web. Helps to filter water of harmful chemicals.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Butterfly Host Plant: It is a primary larval host (caterpillar food) for the African Grass Yellow, the Broad-bordered Grass Yellow, and the Angled Grass Yellow</li>
    <li>The bright yellow flowers provide nectar and pollen for various indigenous bees and small insects, which in turn support the insectivorous bird populations found in the Mistbelt.. </li>
    <li>Pioneer Species: It acts as a hardy pioneer, stabilising soil in disturbed patches or along the edges of trails within the reserve, preventing erosion.
</li>
  </ul>
